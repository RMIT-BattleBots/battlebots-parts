## How to contribute!

Before you start to code you will need to create branch, the naming convention is shown below:

`{TYPE_OF_PULLREQUEST}/{DESCRIPTION}`

e.g.

`documentation/create_contributing_guidelines`
`documentation/include_binary_cad`

- NOTE: keep everything in lowercase and use "\_"

### TYPE_OF_PULLREQUEST

The type of pull request.
e.g.

- documentation
- bugfix
- feature (eventually when we will start coding our own components)

### DECRIPTION
